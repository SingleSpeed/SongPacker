By God's word at last my sin I learned;\nThen I trembled at the law I'd spurned,\nTill my guilty soul imploring turned\nTo Calvary.\n\n3. Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'rything;\nNow I gladly own Him as my King;\nNow my raptured soul can only sing\nOf Calvary.\n\n4. O the love that drew salvation's plan!\nO the grace that bro't it down to man!\nO the mighty gulf that God did span\nAt Calvary!",

See, from his head, his hands, his feet,\nSorrow and love flow mingled down.\nDid e'er such love and sorrow meet,\nOr thorns compose so rich a crown?\n\n4. Were the whole realm of nature mine,\nThat were a present far too small.\nLove so amazing, so divine,\nDemands my soul, my life, my all.",

Enough for me that Jesus saves,\nThis ends my fear and doubt;\nA sinful soul I come to Him,\nHe'll never cast me out.\n\n3. My heart is leaning on the Word,\nThe written Word of God,\nSalvation by my Saviour's name,\nSalvation thro' His blood.\n\n4. My great Physician heals the sick,\nThe lost He came to save;\nFor me His precious blood He shed,\nFor me His life He gave.",

On every hand the foe we find\nDrawn up in dread array;\nLet tents of ease be left behind,\nAnd onward to the fray.\nSalvation's helmet on each head,\nWith truth all girt about,\nThe earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,\nAnd echo with our shout.\n\n4. To him that overcomes the foe\nWhite raiment shall be giv'n;\nBefore the angels he shall know\nHis name confessed in heav'n;\nThen onward from the hills of light,\nOur hearts with love aflame\nWe'll vanquish all the hosts of night,\nIn Jesus' conqu'ring name.",

A mighty fortress is our God,\nA bulwark never failing;\nOur helper He, amid the flood\nOf mortal ills prevailing.\nFor still our ancient foe\nDoth seek to work us woe;\nHis craft and pow'r are great,\nAnd, armed with cruel hate,\nOn earth is not his equal.\n\n2. Did we in our own strength confide,\nOur striving would be losing;\nWere not the right Man on our side,\nThe Man of God's own choosing.\nDost ask who that may be?\nChrist Jesus, it is He;\nLord Sabaoth His name,\nFrom age to age the same,\nAnd He must win the battle.\n\n3. And tho' this world, with demons filled,\nShould threaten to undo us;\nWe will not fear. for God hath willed\nHis truth to triumph through us.\nThe prince of darkness grim\nWe tremble not for him;\nHis rage we can endure,\nFor lo! his doom is sure,\nOne little word shall fell him.",

No condemnation now I dread;\nJesus, and all in Him, is mine!\nAlive in Him, my living Head,\nAnd clothed in righteousness Divine,\nBold I approach the eternal throne,\nAnd claim the crown, through Christ my own.",

O teach me what it meaneth,\nThy love beyond compare,\nThe love that reacheth deeper\nThan depths of self-despair!\nYes, teach me, till there gloweth\nIn this cold heart of mine\nSome feeble, pale reflection\nOf that pure love of Thine.\n\n4. O teach me what it meaneth,\nFor I am full of sin,\nAnd grace alone can reach me,\nAnd love alone can win.\nO teach me, for I need Thee,\nI have no hope beside--\u0094\nThe chief of all the sinners\nFor whom the Savior died!\n\n5.
