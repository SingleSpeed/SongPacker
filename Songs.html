Days may be coming fraught with loss and change,\nNew scenes surround my life, and faces strange;\nI thank Thee that no day can ever break,\nSavior, when Thou wilt leave me or forsake.\n\n3. There may be days of darkness and distress,\nWhen sin has power to tempt, and care to press--\nYet in the darkest day I will not fear,\nFor, 'mid the shadows, Thou wilt still be near.\n\n4. Days there may be of joy, and deep delight,\nWhen earth seems fairest, and her skies most bright;\nThen draw me closer to Thee, lest I rest\nElsewhere, my Savior, than upon Thy breast.\n\n5. And all the other days that make my life,\nMarked by no special joy or grief or strife,\nDays filled with quiet duties, trivial care,\nBurdens too small for other hearts to share;\n\n6. Spend Thou those days with me, all shall be Thine--\u0094\nSo shall the darkest hour with glory shine.\nThen, when these earthly years have passed away,\nLet me be with Thee in the perfect day.",

Here would I feed upon the bread of God,\nHere drink with Thee the royal wine of heaven;\nHere would I lay aside each earthly load,\nHere taste afresh the calm of sin forgiven.\n\n3. This is the hour of banquet and of song;\nThis is the heavenly table spread for me:\nHere let me feast, and feasting, still prolong\nThe brief bright hour of fellowship with Thee.\n\n4. Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;\nThe feast, though not the love, is past and gone;\nThe bread and wine remove, but Thou are here,\nNearer than ever, still our Shield and Sun.\n\n5. Feast after feast thus comes and passes by;\nYet passing, points to the great feast above,\nGiving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,\nThe Lamb's great bridal feast of bliss and love.",

If from every sin you part,\nAnd let Christ have all your heart,\nYou need fear no fiery dart,\nWhile you trust Him.\nFor while Jesus reigns within,\nYou are proof against all sin,\nAnd His perfect peace you'll win,\nHallelujah!",

I wander'd on in the darkness,\nNot a ray of light could I see:\nAnd the thought filled my heart with sadness,\nThere's no hope for a sinner like me.\n\n3. And then, in that dark lonely hour,\nA voice sweetly whispered to me.\nSaying, Christ the Redeemer has power\nTo save a poor sinner like me.\n\n4. I listened: and lo! 'Twas the Saviour\nThat was speaking so kindly to me;\nAnd I cried, --\u009cI'm the chief of sinners:\nCanst Thou save a poor sinner like me?--\u009d\n\n5. I then fully trusted in Jesus;\nAnd oh, now a joy came to me!\nMy heart was filled with His praises,\nFor saving a sinner like me.\n\n6. No longer in darkness I'm walking,\nThe light is now shining on me;\nAnd now unto others I'm telling\nHow He saved a poor sinner like me.\n\n7. And when life's journey is over,\nAnd I the dear Saviour shall see,\nI'll praise Him for ever and ever,\nFor saving a sinner like me!",

From heaven You came, helpless Babe\nEntered our world, Your glory veil'd,\nNot to be served but to serve\nAnd give Your life that we might live.\n\nChorus:\nThis is our God, the servant King\nHe calls us now to follow Him\nTo bring our lives as a daily offering\nOf worship to the servant King\n\nWomen Only:\n2. There in the garden of tears\nMy heavy load, He chose to bear\nHis heart with sorrow was torn\n\"Yet not my will, but Yours\" He said.\n\n3. Come see His hands and His feet,\nThe scars that speak of sacrifice\nHands that flung stars into space,\nTo cruel nails surrendered.\n\n4. So let us learn how to serve,\nAnd in our lives, enthrone Him\nEach others needs to prefer,\nFor it is Christ we're serving.",
