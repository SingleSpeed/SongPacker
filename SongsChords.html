O safe and happy shelter,\nO refuge tried and sweet,\nO trysting-place where heaven's love\nAnd heaven's justice meet!\nAs to the holy patriarch\nThat wondrous dream was giv'n,\nSo seems my Savior's cross to me,\nA ladder up to heav'n.\n\n3. Upon that cross of Jesus,\nMine eye at times can see\nThe very dying form of One\nWho suffered there for me;\nAnd from my smitten heart, with tears\nTwo wonders I confess:\nThe wonders of His glorious love,\nAnd my own worthlessness.\n\n4. I take, O cross, thy shadow\nFor my abiding place;\nI ask no other sunshine than\nThe sunshine of His face;\nContent to let the world go by,\nTo know no gain nor loss,\nMy sinful self my only shame,\nMy glory all the cross!",

Living for Jesus a life that is true,\nStriving to please Him in all that I do,\nYielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free\nThis is the pathway of blessing for me.\n\nChorus:\nO Jesus, Lord and Savior,\nI give myself to Thee,\nFor Thou, in Thy atonement\nDidst give Thyself for me.\nI own no other Master,\nMy heart shall be Thy throne:\nMy life I give, henceforth to live,\nO Christ, for Thee alone.\n\n2. Living for Jesus who died in my place,\nBearing on Calv'ry my sin and disgrace;\nSuch love constrains me to answer His call,\nFollow His leading and give Him my all.\n\n3. Living for Jesus wherever I am,\nDoing each duty in His holy name:\nWilling to suffer affliction and loss,\nDeeming each trial a part of my cross.\n\n4. Living for Jesus through earth's little while,\nMy dearest treasure, the light of His smile;\nSeeking the lost ones He died to redeem,\nBringing the weary to find rest in Him.",
